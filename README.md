TrueFalse

Is a sinatra backbone application that renders randome facts or phony facts one at a time to the browser. The user
is then able to decide weather the statement presented to them is true or false. The user is also able to just skip the statement entirely 
for the next statement. 

There is also an API that is in json format, which holds a bunch of statements with a boolean value of true or false.
